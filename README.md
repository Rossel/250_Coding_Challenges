# 250 Coding Challenges
These are my solutions to a Python course which offers 250 coding challenges called [Python 3 Workout](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-exercises/). I made these exercises alongside the [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) course by Jose Portilla [(Pierian Data)](https://github.com/Pierian-Data), which taught me a broad base of Python coding skills. My certificates for completing the course as well as the 250 challenges can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-65eb15a4-47ed-4bb7-9e75-8dcc1fda9dcc/) and [here](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-36906d52-56c2-4168-a981-8fba0b587415/).
